Welcome to my home page. 
I am a Postdoc Researcher at [Simon Fraser University](https://www.sfu.ca/)and work with Professor [Greg Mori](https://www.cs.sfu.ca/~mori/). 
My research interests are in Computer Vision (e.g., Vision Problems with Temporal Information) and Machine Learning (e.g., Multi-View Problems). 

I was a Ph.D. Student at [Queen Mary University of London (QMUL)](http://www.qmul.ac.uk/).
