Still Under Constructions...

Welcome to my home page. I am now a Ph.D. Student at [Queen Mary University of London (QMUL)](http://www.qmul.ac.uk/). My research interests are in Computer Vision (e.g., Human Related Vision Problems) and Machine Learning (e.g., Deep Learning). My current advisors are [Tao Xiang](https://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/~txiang/) and [Timothy Hospedales](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/thospeda/). Before coming to UK, I was studying at [Sun Yat-sen University](http://www.sysu.edu.cn/2012/en/index.htm). My advisor was [Wei-Shi Zheng](http://isee.sysu.edu.cn/~zhwshi/).
